## How to Use: Windows/Linux Platform

Visit [Video Installation Tutorial](https://github.com/obgnail/typora_plugin/issues/847)

1. [Download](https://github.com/obgnail/typora_plugin/releases/latest) the plugin source code package and unzip it.

2. Go to the Typora installation path and find the folder A containing `window.html`.

   - For the official version of Typora, the path is `./resources/window.html`.

   - For the beta version of Typora, the path is `./resources/app/window.html`.

3. Paste the unzipped plugin folder into folder A.

4. Go to the folder `A/plugin/bin/`.

   - Windows: Right-Click on the file `installw_windows.ps1`. Select 'Run with PowerShell'.
   - Linux: Run `install_linux.sh` as administrator.

5. Verification: Restart Typora, right-click in the main text area, and if you see the `Often Used Plugins` column, everything is fine.

# LIST: List of secondary menu plugins (use "---" to insert a divider on the page for separation)
[[right_click_menu.MENUS]]
