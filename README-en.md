## How to Use: Windows/Linux Platform

Visit [Video Installation Tutorial](https://github.com/obgnail/typora_plugin/issues/847)

1. [Download](https://github.com/obgnail/typora_plugin/releases/latest) the plugin source code package and unzip it.

2. Go to the Typora installation path and find the folder A containing `window.html`.

   - For the official version of Typora, the path is `./resources/window.html`.
   
   - For the free version of Typora, the path is `./resources/app/window.html`.

3. Paste the unzipped plugin folder into folder A.

4. Go to the folder `A/plugin/bin/`.

   - Windows: Double-click to run `install_windows_amd_x64.exe`. If you see the following image, the installation is successful.
   
   - Linux: Run `install_linux.sh` as administrator. If you see the following image, the installation is successful.

5. Verification: Restart Typora, right-click in the main text area, and if you see the `Often Used Plugins` column, everything is fine.

## Q&A

### Is my version of Typora supported?

All plugins have been tested on version 0.9.98 (the last free version) and the latest version. This project theoretically supports all Typora versions, but Typora's functionality stabilized after version 0.9.98. **It is recommended to use version 0.9.98 or later**.


### Will the plugins become invalid?

Theoretically, they can remain effective for a long time, and I am maintaining them.


### How to modify plugin configurations?

The project includes over 600 configuration options, allowing a comprehensive definition of each plugin's behavior.

Right-click menu -> Less Used Plugins -> Preferences.


### How to upgrade plugins?

Right-click menu -> Often Used Plugins -> Secondary Plugins -> Upgrade Plugins.


### I don't want to use it anymore, how to uninstall the plugin system?

Right-click menu -> Less Used Plugins -> Help -> Uninstall Plugins.


### Does it support Typora for Mac?

I don't have a Mac device, so I haven't tested it.

Before using this plugin, you need to set the following configuration options:

# Resource root directory, supports absolute paths (such as D:\\tmp\\img) and relative paths (such as .\\assets). Pay attention to escaping backslashes when filling in (if empty, this plugin is invalid)

### truncate_text: Hide Content to Improve Large File Rendering Performance

- Hide the front part: Hide the text in the front part, leaving only the last 80 paragraphs.
- Redisplay: Redisplay all previously hidden text.
- Display according to the current visible range: Display text according to the current visible range.

> collapse_paragraph (Chapter Collapse) can well replace this plugin, it is recommended to use collapse_paragraph.
